    <p>Check this if you want the instance to be stopped instead of terminated when it times out
    due to being idle. This allows existing instances to be used when provisioning a agent.
    You would use this option to preserve the state of the instance, including that of the
    EBS volume connections.</p>
    <p>Note that instance store content is lost, as are running processes and the contents of memory.</p>
    <p><b>For Windows agents, stopping and starting an instance starts a new hourly billing cycle, so short stop timeouts are counterproductive.</b></p>

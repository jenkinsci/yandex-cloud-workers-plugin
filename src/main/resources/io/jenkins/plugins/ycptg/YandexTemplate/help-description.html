<div>
Optional human-readable description of this agent. This information is displayed on the project
configuration screen.
<br>
When you have agents that are different from others,
it's often helpful to use this field to explain what is different.
For example, entering "Windows agent" in this field would allow project owners to
choose to always build on a Windows machine (for example, if they need some Windows-specific build tool.)
